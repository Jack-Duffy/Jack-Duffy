This is where I am going to add things about my life like my hobbies, family, and friends.

Not quite there yet!


Who am I?

My Name is jack Duffy and some of my favorite things to do are snowboarding and playing video games. I hope to become an engineer and eventually a buisness owner. Some of my goals in this class are to learn how to code so I can put my 3d animation skill together with coding and create video games.
